          at e-conomic we used to have two big  M O N O L I T H  s
          
          we were hitting more and more of the cons
          
          - taking FOREVER for new devs to start pushing stuff
          - dev tools starting to break down because of too much code
          - deployment + qa become a bigger and bigger problem
          - LOTS of tables in the same database - no clear picture
